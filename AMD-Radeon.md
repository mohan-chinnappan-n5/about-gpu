AMD Radeon™ RX graphics cards are a series of GPUs developed by AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) under the Radeon brand. These GPUs are designed for gaming, content creation, and professional applications, offering high performance, advanced features, and support for the latest graphics technologies. The Radeon RX series includes a wide range of cards catering to different segments, from budget-friendly options to high-end models for enthusiasts.

### Key Features of AMD Radeon™ RX Graphics Cards

1. **RDNA Architecture**
   - The Radeon RX series is built on AMD's RDNA (Radeon DNA) architecture, which is designed to deliver high performance and power efficiency. RDNA introduces significant improvements in instructions per clock (IPC) and efficiency over the previous GCN (Graphics Core Next) architecture.
   - RDNA 2, an enhanced version of RDNA, brings additional features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing, variable rate shading, and improved performance per watt.

2. **Ray Tracing**
   - Starting with the RDNA 2 architecture, Radeon RX graphics cards include hardware-accelerated ray tracing support. This allows for realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in games that support ray tracing.
   - AMD's approach to ray tracing is designed to balance performance and visual quality, making it accessible on a range of hardware.

3. **FidelityFX Suite**
   - AMD FidelityFX is a collection of open-source, high-quality visual effects that developers can integrate into their games. These include features like Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS), Screen Space Reflections (SSR), and Variable Rate Shading (VRS).
   - FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is another key technology, offering spatial upscaling to improve performance in supported games while maintaining visual quality.

4. **Smart Access Memory (SAM)**
   - Smart Access Memory allows the CPU to access the entire GPU memory, which can lead to performance improvements in certain games. This feature works best when paired with AMD Ryzen processors and Radeon RX GPUs.

5. **Infinity Cache**
   - Certain high-end Radeon RX graphics cards feature Infinity Cache, a high-speed cache that reduces memory latency and increases bandwidth, contributing to higher performance in gaming workloads.

6. **PCIe 4.0 Support**
   - Radeon RX GPUs support PCIe 4.0, which offers double the bandwidth of PCIe 3.0. This is particularly beneficial for data-heavy tasks like gaming at high resolutions and transferring large datasets.

7. **Multi-Monitor and VR Support**
   - Radeon RX graphics cards support multi-monitor setups with technologies like Eyefinity, which allows for seamless multi-display configurations.
   - They also support Virtual Reality (VR), providing the necessary performance and features to drive immersive VR experiences.

8. **Cooling Solutions**
   - AMD Radeon RX graphics cards come with advanced cooling solutions, including custom coolers from board partners. These cooling solutions are designed to keep temperatures low while maintaining quiet operation, even under heavy loads.

9. **Adrenalin Software**
   - AMD's Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition provides users with a suite of tools to optimize gaming performance, customize settings, and monitor hardware. Features like Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Boost, and Radeon Chill help improve responsiveness, performance, and power efficiency.
